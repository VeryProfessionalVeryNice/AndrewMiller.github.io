<article>Euler Biography Text
<h1>  
Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)
</h1>
<p>
The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, 
<strong>Leonhard Euler</strong> was born in Basel, Switzerland. There, 
he studied under another giant of mathematics, <strong>Jean 
Bernoulli</strong>. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics 
and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. 
Euler was the most prolific mathematician of all time, 
publishing over <em>800 different books and papers. His 
influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well.
</p>
<p>
He is perhaps best known for his research into 
mathematical analysis. Euler's work, 
<cit>Introductio in analysin infinitorum (1748)</cit>, 
remained a standard textbook in the field for 
well over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau, 
he wrote 
<cit>Lettres &agrave; une princesse d'Allemagne (1768-1772)</cit>, 
giving a clear non-technical outline of the main 
physical theories of the time.
</p>
<p>
One can hardly write a mathematical equation without 
copying Euler. Notations still in use today, such 
as <var>e</var> and <var>&pi;</var>, were introduced 
in Euler's writings. Leonhard Euler died in 1783, 
leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and 
certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.

<h1>The Most Beautiful Equation in Math?</h1>
<p>
Perhaps the most elegant equation in the history of math is:
</p>
<code>cos(x)+isin(x)=e<sup>xi</sup></code>
<p>
which demonstrates the relationship between algebra, 
complex analysis, and trigonometry. From this 
equation, it's easy to derive the identity:
</p>
<code>e<sup>&pi;i</sup>+1=0</code>
<p>
which relates the fundamental constants: 
<var>0</var>, <var>1</var>, <var>&pi;</var>, <var>e</var>, and <var>i</var> in a single beautiful and 
elegant statement. A poll of readers 
conducted by <cit>The Mathematical Intelligencer</cit>
magazine named Euler's Identity as the 
most beautiful theorem in the history of 
mathematics.</p></aside>
